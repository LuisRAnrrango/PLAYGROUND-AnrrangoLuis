          Hi, Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer and information. I am 28 years old and
          my favorite hobbies are playing soccer. Currently, in addition to
          personal projects, I have only had experience in one company. I like
          to work in a team with anyone, however, I am also very good working
          alone
